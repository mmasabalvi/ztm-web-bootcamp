Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class: define and group elemnts as class, treat as one
#id: use with div tag, same as class, but each used once only
*: for all elements
element
element, element
element(y) element(x): Appling to all x inside of y
element(y) > element(x): Applying to all x which has parent y, meaning just directly under x
element(y) + element(x): Selecting the x right after y
:hover - Used to hover text, used infron of element
:last-child - for applying on the first element of class/div
:first-child - for applying on the last element of class/div
!important (not recommended) - Used to overwrite past code even if new updates made


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
